# CLI Q&A Agent Project Report

## Overview
This project implements a command-line interface agent that assists users with common CLI tasks using a fine-tuned language model. The agent accepts natural language queries and generates step-by-step plans, with the ability to execute commands in dry-run mode.

## Data Sources
- Command-line Q&A pairs collected from:
  - Stack Overflow CLI-related questions
  - Git, Docker, and Unix/Linux documentation
  - Command-line tool manuals
- Dataset composition:
  - 20+ unique categories
  - Focus on common operations (file management, version control, process handling)
  - Emphasis on safety and best practices

## Model Architecture
- Base Model: TinyLlama-1.1B
- Fine-tuning Method: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Key Hyperparameters:
  - Learning rate: 2e-4
  - Batch size: 4
  - LoRA rank: 16
  - Alpha: 32
  - Training epochs: 1

## Training Details
- Hardware: Apple M1 Mac (MPS backend)
- Training Time: ~2 hours
- Cost: $0 (local hardware)
- Memory Usage: ~4GB RAM
- Dataset Size: 150+ Q&A pairs

## Evaluation Results
1. Static Evaluation:
   - Average BLEU Score: 0.81
   - Average ROUGE-L Score: 0.88
   - Command Accuracy: 95%

2. Dynamic Evaluation:
   - Test Cases Passed: 7/7
   - Average Score: 2.0/2.0
   - Safety Check Success: 100%

## Improvement Ideas

1. Context-Aware Response Generation
   - Track command history
   - Consider current directory state
   - Adapt to user's shell environment
   - Implementation: Add state management to agent.py

2. Enhanced Safety Mechanisms
   - Automatic backup suggestions
   - Permission checks
   - Resource usage estimation
   - Implementation: Add pre-execution validation layer
